Mohit Jain

Operator across product, growth, and user support

Intro / Hero
I like being close to the mess — and making things work.

I’m an operator across product, growth, and user support.
I work best in fast-moving teams where problems are unclear, users are vocal, and shipping something now matters more than perfect plans.

I enjoy challenges, variety, and solving new problems — not repeating the same task every day. I’m quick to experiment, iterate, and figure things out under constraints.

What I Actually Do

I’ve worked across community, partnerships, product, and growth — usually at the point where users, systems, and timelines collide.

I’m not precious about titles or roles. If something needs to be shipped and engineering bandwidth is tight, I’ll figure out a way to make it work.

Quick Highlights

6× community growth at CHOMP through tournaments, rewards, and hands-on support

80K+ impressions & 4K+ sign-ups from campaigns, collaborations, and quests

30+ partner integrations built at Tezos India

25+ events & meetups organized across Indian cities

Proof of Execution
AI Product Support & Experience OS

Handled ~70 user issues per week across Telegram and Twitter.
Designed a simple but effective support system:

Dedicated bug-reporting channels by issue type

Clear escalation context (wallet, OS, recordings, environment)

FAQ and announcement channels to reduce noise

Regular user communication during bugs or changes

Outcome:
Fewer repeated issues, clearer expectations, and users coming to me directly instead of founders.

Gamified Engagement System at CHOMP

We ran a 5,000-user tournament (“The Ultimate CHOMPer”), but users had no way to track their progress. Frustration was growing and engineering bandwidth was limited.

I shipped a workaround myself:

Vibe-coded a leaderboard using a REST endpoint via Retool

Displayed rank, points, wallet address, tournament status, and timeline

Refreshed every 6 hours

Outcome:
Higher tournament participation and retention because users could finally see where they stood.

What broke:
Retool tokens expired once while I was asleep, showing mock data for ~4 hours. Fixed immediately when caught.

Campaign Microsite with Real-Time Leaderboard

Designed and shipped a campaign microsite with real-time database sync to:

Track leaderboard progress

Automate prize distribution

Reduce manual ops during campaigns

Shipped end-to-end without waiting on engineering.

Internal Dashboards & Systems

Built SQL-driven and Retool dashboards to track:

Growth and engagement

Campaign performance

Operational KPIs

The goal was simple: help teams make decisions without waiting on someone else.

Why AI

I’m not an AI engineer. I’m close to users and workflows.

AI is my first brain:

I use it daily for research, analysis, planning, and prioritization

I build simple AI-powered automations (like daily email digests via n8n + LLMs)

I use AI to move faster, not to sound impressive

I’m most excited about AI products that:

Preserve context (voice, memory, workflows)

Help people act, not just chat

Solve real problems for teams and individuals

What I’m Looking For

I want to join an early-stage AI company where I can:

Be close to users

Own messy problems across product, growth, or GTM

Learn fast by shipping and iterating

I care deeply about ethics. I won’t work on products designed to exploit addiction, debt, or manipulation.
